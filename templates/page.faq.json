A full aperture filter allows the most light into the telescope because it allows the full aperture of your telescope to be viewed. This allows the best possible daytime viewing when there is minimal atmospheric turbulence. If turbulence is present, a mask can be put over the end of the filter to effectively reduce the aperture. With a mask you can effectively change the aperture range to anything less than full aperture depending on the size of the mask. An off axis solar filter cannot be used on a refracting telescope.<\/li><\/ul>"}},"question_DbTbtH":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Is there a Certification for Solar filers?","text":"<p><em><strong>There is some confusing information and articles out there about solar viewing. To clarify, ISO and CE Certification for Solar Filters does not exist. Any company or article providing information that there is a Certification process for Solar Filters is providing false information. Companies that are claiming they have ISO Certification on their Solar Filters are not being honest. There is a standard established by ISO, but no body to certify filters yet. Seymour Solar's Helios Glass and Helios Film have been sent to an Independent Laboratory which have documented that these two products are safe for viewing and photographing the sun and meet the requirements for ISO 12312-2.
